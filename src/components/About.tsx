            I'm currently Freelancing in <span className="font-semibold">Software Development</span> field.
            My journey into the world of programming was driven by my passion for <span className="font-semibold">problem-solving</span> thrill of taking challenging tasks.
            One of my favorite aspects of programming is the satisfaction that comes from finding solutions to complex problems
        </p>
        <p className=" mb-5 text-lg w-full lg:w-[47rem]">
            During my Studies, I have worked on several projects, with the most notable being <span className="font-semibold">Travel Advisor</span>, an travel guiding website.
            This project was build using <span className="font-semibold">ReactJs, REST API, Context API </span>
            This experience solidified my skills and confirmed my love for full-stack
        </p>
        <p className=" mb-5 text-lg w-full lg:w-[47rem] ">
        I am particularly comfortable with <span className="font-semibold">React.js, TypeScript, Node.js,</span> and <span className="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</span>.
         Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in  <span className="font-semibold">system design</span>.
         These skills and my continuous learning mindset are preparing me for my goal of becoming a full-time  <span className="font-semibold">full-stack developer</span>.
        </p>
        <p className=" mb-5 text-lg w-full lg:w-[47rem] ">
        Beyond programming, I enjoy <span className="font-semibold">traveling</span>, <span className="font-semibold">watching movies</span>, and <span className="font-semibold">playing outdoor games</span>.
         These interests not only help me unwind but also inspire creativity in my projects. 
        I am excited to continue learning and growing in the tech field and look forward to contributing to innovative projects as a full-stack developer.
